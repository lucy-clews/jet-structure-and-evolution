This file contains the functions that allow a user to create a table of all
the known sources in the catalogue.  To reduce this catalogue down to a 
sub-catalogue of nearby sources to the sources which have succuessfully drawn
a ridgeline and create a table.  Then to create text files of the possible
sources in a cutout (size generated and used in the Ridgeline code).

These text files are used to determine the pixel distance of all these possible
sources from the LOFAR catalogue position of the corresponding source, the
perpendicular distance of the possible sources from the corresponding
ridgeline and the distance of the source along the ridgeline. This information 
is stored in a further text file which is used to study the N closest sources 
to the LOFAR catalogue position.

Functions to create tables from catalogues with the required information.
Functions to create .txt files with the catalogue information in.
Functions to create .txt files with the LOFAR distance and Perpendicular
distances in.
Functions to obtain the closest N sources, how many are host ID's and the
distances of all these sources.

This file deals with just the host sources of the ridgelines.  It contains
the functions that are used to determine the perpendicular distance of the
host from the ridgeline of the source and from the LOFAR catalogue position
corresponding to the source.  These are looped so all hosts distances are
contained in two seperate lists.

Functions for obtaining which sources pointofinlly drew ridgelines.
Functions for obtaining perpendicular pixel distances.
Functions for obtaining pixel distance from LOFAR catalogue position.
Functions for obtaining the distance along the ridgeline of the host source.

Edited from 22/01/20

This file contains further functions for generating the perpendicular distance
from the ridgeline and the distance from the LOFAR Catalogue position using
the distance including uncertainties formula in Best et. al. (2003)
(see end of file for ref.), and those functions required to use these distances
to generate the likelihood ratio used in this paper.  All of this information
is stored in text files created in the running of the functions.

Functions to create tables and .txt files.
Functions to calculate R distance to ridgeline and LOFAR Catalogue postion
and create.txt files.
Functions to calculate the corresponding likelihood ratios and create .txt
files.

These functions deal with the host for the radio sources and with the closest 
n sources to the LOFAR catalogue position.
